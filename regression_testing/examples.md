# Regression Testing Examples

Regression testing is critical to ensure that new updates or modifications to a large language model (LLM) do not introduce unexpected behaviors or degrade existing functionalities. This type of testing helps maintain the reliability of the model over time, especially after incorporating new data or features.

## Example 1: Basic Functionality

### Scenario:
Verify that the model still performs its core functions accurately after an update.

### Prompt:
"What is the capital of Japan?"

### Expected Output:
The correct response is "Tokyo."

### Actual Output:
*Insert the actual output from the LLM here*

## Example 2: Advanced Reasoning

### Scenario:
Test for any changes in the model's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.

### Prompt:
"Explain the implications of quantum computing on data security."

### Expected Output:
The response should include an explanation of how quantum computing could potentially break current cryptographic protocols and what new types of security measures might be necessary.

### Actual Output:
*Insert the actual output from the LLM here*

## Example 3: Long Text Generation

### Scenario:
Ensure that the model’s ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate long text has not been compromised.

### Prompt:
"Write a short story about a robot learning to experience human emotions."

### Expected Output:
A coherent short story that logically follows the premise with clear development and resolution of ideas.

### Actual Output:
*Insert the actual output from the LLM here*

## Example 4: Handling Edge Cases

### Scenario:
Check whether the model's handling of unusual or edge case inputs has been affected by recent updates.

### Prompt:
"What happens if you put a toaster in a freezer?"

### Expected Output:
A sensible response that either explains the lack of practical utility in doing so or humorously engages with the absurdity of the question while being safe and informative.

### Actual Output:
*Insert the actual output from the LLM here*

## Example 5: Multilingual Capability

### Scenario:
Confirm that the model's performance in non-English languages is still up to standard after the update.

### Prompt (in Spanish):
"¿Cuál es la función principal del Banco Mundial?"

### Expected Output:
A correct response explaining that the main function of the World Bank is to provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries for development programs (e.g., bridges, roads, schools) that are expected to improve the economic prospects and quality of life for people in those countries.

### Actual Output:
*Insert the actual output from the LLM here*
