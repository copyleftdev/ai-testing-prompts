# Regression Testing

## Overview

Regression testing is crucial for ensuring that updates or modifications to a large language model (LLM) do not inadvertently introduce errors or degrade existing functionalities. This type of testing verifies that new code changes have not negatively impacted the model's performance in areas that were previously functioning correctly.

## Importance

The significance of regression testing includes:
- **Maintaining Stability**: Ensures that the LLM remains stable and reliable, even after incorporating new features, data, or code updates.
- **Ensuring Quality**: Helps maintain the quality of the model by catching bugs and issues early, before they affect end-users.
- **Facilitating Continuous Improvement**: Supports ongoing development by allowing teams to integrate changes frequently while ensuring the overall system remains robust.

## How to Use This Guide

The `examples.md` file contains a series of test prompts designed to check various aspects of the LLM’s functionality after updates. Here’s how to utilize these examples effectively:

1. **Review the Examples**: Each example includes a prompt with a specific testing focus, whether it's basic functionality, advanced reasoning, or handling edge cases. Understand what each test aims to verify.
2. **Conduct Tests**: Use these prompts to test the LLM after updates and record its outputs. Ensure that the testing environment replicates real-world operating conditions as closely as possible.
3. **Document Results**: Note the actual outputs and compare them with expected outputs. This documentation is crucial for identifying any regression issues.
4. **Analyze and Diagnose**: Analyze any deviations from expected results to determine the cause of the regression. Identify whether they are due to the new changes or other factors.
5. **Iterate and Refine**: Based on the findings, make necessary adjustments to the code or model training. Re-test to confirm that the issues have been resolved and that no new issues have emerged.

Contributions to enhance our regression testing protocols are highly valued. If you have suggestions for new tests, improvements to existing ones, or innovative methods for automating these tests, please refer to our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on how to contribute effectively.

## Conclusion

Regression testing is a vital component of the development cycle for LLMs, ensuring that each update improves the model without compromising its existing capabilities. By rigorously testing and validating each change, we can continue to advance the model’s capabilities while maintaining a high standard of reliability and performance.
