# Performance Testing Examples

Performance testing evaluates the computational efficiency and scalability of a large language model (LLM) under varying loads and conditions. This type of testing is crucial for applications where response time and resource utilization are critical factors, such as in real-time applications and large-scale deployments.

## Example 1: Response Time Under Low Load

### Scenario:
Test the response time of the LLM when handling a single, straightforward query.

### Prompt:
"What is the capital of France?"

### Expected Performance:
The LLM should return a response in under 300 milliseconds under low system load.

### Actual Performance:
*Insert the actual response time and system load here*

## Example 2: Response Time Under High Load

### Scenario:
Evaluate the LLM's response time when simultaneously handling multiple complex queries.

### Prompts:
1. "Explain the theory of relativity."
2. "Summarize the plot of 'War and Peace'."
3. "Describe the process of photosynthesis."

### Expected Performance:
The LLM should manage to return responses for all queries within 2 seconds under high load conditions.

### Actual Performance:
*Insert the actual response times and system load here*

## Example 3: Scalability Testing

### Scenario:
Assess the scalability of the LLM by gradually increasing the number of concurrent requests until a threshold is reached where performance degrades.

### Test Setup:
Start with 10 concurrent requests and double the number every 5 minutes until response times exceed 5 seconds.

### Expected Performance:
The LLM should handle up to 100 concurrent requests without significant degradation in response times.

### Actual Performance:
*Insert details of when performance began to degrade, the number of requests handled, and response times here*

## Example 4: Resource Utilization

### Scenario:
Monitor the LLM's resource usage (CPU, memory) during a typical query processing task.

### Prompt:
"Provide a detailed analysis of the economic impact of climate change."

### Expected Performance:
CPU usage should not exceed 70% and memory usage should remain below 2 GB for the task.

### Actual Performance:
*Insert the actual CPU and memory usage here*

## Example 5: Efficiency Over Extended Periods

### Scenario:
Test the LLM's efficiency and resource management over an extended period of continuous operation.

### Test Duration:
24 hours of continuous querying with varied complexity.

### Expected Performance:
The LLM should maintain consistent response times and resource usage should not gradually increase over the test period (no memory leaks).

### Actual Performance:
*Insert observations on response consistency and resource usage stability here*
