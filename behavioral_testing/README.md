# Behavioral Testing

## Overview

Behavioral testing is fundamental in evaluating how a large language model (LLM) like GPT responds across a variety of contexts and scenarios. This form of testing ensures that the model behaves in a consistent, appropriate, and predictable manner, adhering to the intended use case requirements and ethical guidelines.

## Importance

Behavioral testing checks for:
- **Consistency**: Ensuring the model's responses are stable and uniform across similar types of queries.
- **Appropriateness**: Making certain that responses are suitable for the context and audience.
- **Accuracy**: Verifying that the information provided is correct and reliable.

## How to Use This Guide

In the `examples.md` file, you will find a series of example prompts designed to test different aspects of the LLM's behavior. Each prompt is accompanied by a description of the expected output, allowing testers to evaluate the model's performance:

1. **Review Examples**: Go through each example to understand what specific behavior each test is evaluating.
2. **Run Tests**: Use these prompts to conduct tests on the LLM. Document the outputs generated by the model.
3. **Compare and Analyze**: Align the modelâ€™s responses with the expected outputs detailed in the examples. This comparison helps identify how well the model adheres to behavioral expectations.
4. **Iterate and Refine**: Based on your findings, you may need to adjust the prompts or create new ones to further explore the model's behavior in different contexts.

We encourage contributions that enhance our behavioral testing protocols. If you have developed new tests or refined existing ones, please refer to the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on how to submit your contributions.

## Conclusion

Behavioral testing is integral to developing LLMs that are not only functional but also align with ethical standards and practical expectations. Through rigorous testing, we can ensure that our models serve their intended purposes effectively and safely in diverse environments.
