# Integration Testing Examples

Integration testing evaluates the ability of a large language model (LLM) to operate effectively within a larger system. This involves testing the interactions between the LLM and other software components to ensure that they work together as expected. These examples focus on common scenarios where LLMs might be integrated into various applications and services.

## Example 1: LLM with a Web Application

### Description:
Testing how the LLM integrates with a web application to provide dynamic content generation based on user inputs.

### Scenario:
A web application uses the LLM to generate product descriptions based on user-provided specifications.

### Test:
1. **Prompt**: User inputs specifications for a new tech gadget.
2. **Expected Interaction**: The web application sends these specifications to the LLM.
3. **Expected Output**: The LLM generates an accurate and relevant product description which the web application displays to the user.

### Actual Interaction and Output:
*Insert the actual interaction and output from the system here*

## Example 2: LLM with a Chatbot Interface

### Description:
Evaluate the LLM's ability to function as part of a customer service chatbot system.

### Scenario:
A customer service chatbot powered by the LLM interacts with users to resolve common queries about account management.

### Test:
1. **Prompt**: User asks how to reset their password.
2. **Expected Interaction**: The chatbot interfaces with the LLM to interpret the query and generate a response.
3. **Expected Output**: The LLM provides a clear, concise instruction for resetting passwords, which the chatbot relays to the user.

### Actual Interaction and Output:
*Insert the actual interaction and output from the system here*

## Example 3: LLM with an API Service

### Description:
Testing the integration of the LLM with an external API to enhance response capabilities.

### Scenario:
The LLM uses a weather API to provide real-time weather updates within a travel planning application.

### Test:
1. **Prompt**: User requests weather updates for Paris.
2. **Expected Interaction**: The LLM retrieves data from the weather API and integrates this information into a comprehensive response.
3. **Expected Output**: The LLM outputs a detailed weather forecast for Paris, suitable for travel planning.

### Actual Interaction and Output:
*Insert the actual interaction and output from the system here*

## Example 4: LLM with Database Systems

### Description:
Assess the LLM's ability to query and retrieve data from a database for dynamic content generation.

### Scenario:
The LLM is used to fetch and summarize financial reports from a corporate database for quarterly business reviews.

### Test:
1. **Prompt**: Request a summary of the latest quarterly financial report.
2. **Expected Interaction**: The LLM queries the database, retrieves the necessary data, and generates a summary.
3. **Expected Output**: A concise, accurate summary of the financial report is generated by the LLM.

### Actual Interaction and Output:
*Insert the actual interaction and output from the system here*
